		<h6>People</h6>
		<p>I almost forgot to include this section! I wouldn't have 90% of this list if I didn't have a wonderful group of people that I had connected with. You can read all the websites in the world, but people are the one resource that can make the biggest difference as you are beginnning. So far, I've had three people that have been a huge help in different ways. I've made a friend in the Rails course that I'm taking. She has been able to explain concepts that I struggle to understand and, somehow, she always knows when I'm getting frustrated. My instructor happens to be an old friend and the person that convinced me to give this a try. He's always there when I have questions and problems. Even better, he's always ready with a high-five when I figure something out for myself. The third person is who I look to when I'm thinking about where I want to be in two years. She's a wonderful example of what a person is capable of achieving and is great about encouraging new learners. All of these people have been directly encouraging in their conversations with me, but seeing each of them in action motivates me to keep going. Everyone needs some people like that.</p>

			<a href="http://www.meetup.com/"><dt>Meetup</dt></a>
			<dd>Use this site to find other developers in your area. Some groups will be general and others may focus on specific development types. You may also be able to find a local meetup of Rails Girls. Meetup makes it easy to find your people.</dd>
			<a href="http://railsgirls.com/events"><dt>Rails Girls</dt></a>
			<dd>There may be an upcoming Rails Girls event in your area! If not, the guides for getting started are posted on this site and are very easy to follow.</dd>

		<h6>Learning Code Basics</h6>
		<dl>
			<a href="http://www.codecademy.com"><dt>Code Academy</dt></a>
			<dd>This is a great first stop for most coding basics. These courses explain concepts as you go, whereas some other sites are more "do first, explain later."</dd>
			<a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><dt>Learn Ruby the Hard Way</dt></a>
			<dd>Ruby the Hard Way has many, many exercises. I think it is most helpful after completing Ruby on Code Academy. It's great practice and helps ingrain concepts, but is less helpful in explaining concepts.</dd>
			<a href="http://www.codeschool.com"><dt>Code School</dt></a>
			<dd>Code School is similar to Code Academy. However, while it does have some free courses, a lot of the site is subscripion-based. Code School is not quite as beginner-friendly as Code Academy.</dd>

		<h6>Cheatsheets and Quick Reference</h6>
		<dl>
			<a href="http://www.pragtob.info/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/"><dt>Rails Beginner Cheatsheet</dt></a>
			<dd>This covers basics like strings, hashes, and arrays. It assumes that you've already been introduced to the concepts, but can provide another viewpoint, as well as a quick lookup for commands.</dd>
			<a href="http://gitref.org/"><dt>Git Reference</dt></a>
			<dd>This should be your first stop when you forget a Git command.</dd>

		<h6>Code Crisis</h6>
		<dl>
			<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"><dt>Stack Overflow</dt></a>
			<dd>Stack Overflow is especially helpful for very specific problems as opposed to general issues. Search through posts that have already been answered before posting a question of your own. Most questions you can ask as a beginner have already been asked and answered.</dd>
			<a href="http://tutsplus.com/"><dt>Tuts+</dt></a>
			<dd>If you are wanting to learn a specific skill or get started with a new program, this site has excellent free tutorials.</dd>
			<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/"><dt>Site Point</dt></a>
			<dd>You can search by topic (ex. HTML or Ruby) or keyword for helpful articles and tutorials when you get stuck.</dd>

		<h6>Jekyll</h6>
		<dl>

		<h6>Foundation</h6>
		<dl>
			<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/foundation-for-beginners--webdesign-12744"><dt>Foundation for Beginners</dt></a>
			<dd>This series has more than a dozen entries that walk you through the basics of Foundation. It's best to review your HTML and CSS first, because this series does assume a basic understanding of those elements.</dd>
			<a href="http://sudheerdev.github.io/Foundation5CheatSheet/"><dt>Foundation Cheatsheet</dt></a>
			<dd>This is a quick go-to for Foundation syntax once you understand how it works.</dd>

			<dd>This is a chart of colors that can be added staright into stylesheets.</dd>
			<a href="http://www.0to255.com/"><dt>0 to 255</dt></a>
			<dd>Such a cool site for hexadecimal color codes. It's especially great if you want to play with shades of colors.</dd>
